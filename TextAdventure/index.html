    This is a story about the fragility of life. 
    Make your discisions, plan carefully, but 
    always protect life in all forms. If you fail, 
    nobody can help you.<b>You are on your own.</b>
    You are a negotator for the NYPD whose job is 
    de-escalation. In short, if there is a situation 
    where someone can hurt another or himself you have
    to talk to them and stop it from happening. <b>Good Luck.</b>
